## 🧠 Overview

**EvoTune** is a framework for discovering new algorithms by combining:

1. 🧬 Evolutionary search over LLM-generated Python programs, and
2. 🏆 Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune the LLM based on relative program performances.

We show that this synergy improves both the performance and uniqueness of solutions across classic combinatorial problems, including:
- ✅ Bin Packing
- ✅ Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- ✅ FlatPack Problem
